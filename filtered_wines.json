        "notes":"The 2012 Riesling is Lemelson's first to include wine made from the young vines at the estate Meyer Vineyard. The fragrant nose shows peach, lime zest, smoke and mint. The palate shows the fat and fruit of the vintage with lime, nectarine and quince flavors on the mid-palate. The finish is long with chalk notes gaining long after the sip. With time in the bottle, this wine will reveal more mineral notes and evolve to show honey and hints of petrol, an aromatic characteristic unique to this varietal. "

The finished wine was aged on the lees for 5 months with occasional stirring.  The results are bright pineapple, green apple and lemon\/lime fruit framed by intriguing ginger, floral and petrol aromatics.  Although fermented to complete dryness, the palate is rich, long and mineral with excellent natural acidity."

Developed for us by the Dutton Family in 1998, the site consists of 3 sloping blocks planted to three different clones \u2013 15, Dijon 95, and Old Wente \u2013 which yield increasingly distinctive and complex fruit characters. Tangerine, citrus and sandalwood spice aromas are overlaid with a hint of honey. The wine is anchored in fragrant citrus fruits and framed nicely with toasty oak and acidity that brings great balance, integration and length to the palate."
